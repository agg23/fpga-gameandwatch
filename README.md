# Game and Watch for FPGAs

![Promo Image](../assets/promo.jpg)

This core is an original creation by [@agg23](https://github.com/agg23). It is based strongly on the original documentation for the Game and Watch CPU (see [Documentation Overview](docs/overview.md)), but additional supported CPUs in the core (like the SM5a) are based entirely on MAME's implementation. I have tried to accurately transcribe and rewrite the existing documentation and MAME's code into a more understandable, fewer error form. The Pocket platform icon was created by Random11. See [Licensing](#licensing) for more information.
